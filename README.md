# <Secure-Password-Generator>

# This is a Secure Password Generator for all your password needs!


## The App
- I was having trouble coming up with complex passwords on a regular basis.
- This app has helped me solve this problem by instantly providing me passwords whenever needed.
- Everything went smoothly with the build besides the very end, where I was having trouble making sure at least one of every character set was being used. This was because I was using strings instead of arrays. Luckily a little google-fu helped me change them in one sinlge line of code.
